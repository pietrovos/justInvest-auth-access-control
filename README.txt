*****Important -> If you run Problem2cTest, it will clear the password file and remove all the preset users you see below (because of @BeforeAll, which clears the password file), so it would be best to grade this last, thank you *****

1. Download ZIP folder into downloads: /home/sysc4810/Downloads/
2. Extract File instead of ZIP folder into Downloads:  /home/sysc4810/Downloads/
3. Go to terminal and type: cd /home/sysc4810/Downloads/SYSC4810_Assignment/out/artifacts/SYSC4810_Assignment_jar/
4. Now, still in terminal, type: java -jar SYSC4810_Assignment.jar
5. A graphical Interface will appear, where you have the choice to Sign up, or Login in. If you decide you login in, there are already several accounts present in the system. 
Use these accounts to test if the proper permissions show up based on role, since my implementation can only assign roles by manually modifying the passwd.txt file
